# jsplice
jSplice is a novel method to detect differential alternative splicing events from RNA-seq experiments. The method relies on junction reads (mapped reads that span an exon-exon junction) to uncover differentially expressed alternative splicing modules (ASMs). AMSs were introduced by Hu et al. (Nucleic Acids Research 2012) and have the advantage to provide a wide definition for alternative splicing events while avoiding the whole transcript reconstruction problem. jSplice analyzes all ASMs of a given genome and compute the largest fold-change difference (referred to as “relative fold-change”) between two overlapping elements (junctions or exons) of an ASM.
